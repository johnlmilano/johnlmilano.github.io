I have been working for software companies going on a little more than 11 years in multiple positions and have been exposed to a lot of code during my professional career. There has been more than one instance where I purchased a book on a specific language, or someone has given me a book on a specific languge, and I have failed to get past the first two to three chapters. I don't know what it was about me at the time but I just could not get into the text. Yes, it was dry, but I didn't expect Shakespear sililoquies, so even though it was as I thought it would be, I just stopped reading, put the book down and went back to the work issue I was trying to deal with at the moment.

In my most recent job I was managing a team of healthcare integration developers and contractors. Some where onsite and some where offshore. I mainly attended meetings to review functionality and regularly attended sprint reviews but I left a lot of the heavy lifting to my product managers and senior engineers. I didn't get into the code when we discovered bugs that made it to production, because it was simply beyond my skillset. I am not one to sit back and relax while my team is frantically trying to solve a problem, so not having the skill to help didn't sit the best with me.

I come from a technical background and have always been the person who got it done. Not always by myself, I collobrated with tons of people, but I could always count on myself to be part of the solution, not just pass the buck on to a direct report and drive home while they are in the office working most of the night. So when another employment opportunity presented itself I left and planned on starting something new. Little did I know that this something new was not going to work out and I would be left without a job.

Honestly it wasn't the worst thing that has happened to me and I felt pretty burnt out so I decided to take some time away and figure out what my next move was going to be. After a few months of R&R I started looking for work. Wow, was I surprised when finding a job was way more difficult than I thought it was going to be. I found myself reassessing my marketability and found myself liking the solititude of being at home, by myself, looking for jobs. I was regularly browsing LinkedIn to connect to former collegues and I came across an article that stated how Google and other tech giants were changing their hiring criteria to not include a 4 year degree as a requirement, due largely in part to new candiates being considered for employeement after completing coding boot camps. This is when I began my research. I started looking at different schools and watching vdieos on the intracacies of attending coding boot camps and I was enamoured. I decided right then that I was going to attend a school online and complete the full stack web developer program to finally tackle the code monster that was stopping me from being the creator of things.

Oh yeah, in my time being out of work I also assembled a 3d printer from a kit, that was pretty cool too.
